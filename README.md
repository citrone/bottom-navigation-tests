# Bottom Navigation Tests

This project is part of the Chuck Noris Jokes.

I started this project to play arround with bottom navigation. I want to become familliar with how bottom navigation works.

## How final application will look like

I want to have an application with two panes in the bottom navigation. One should be used to display all jokes, and the other one to
display jokes filtered on categories.

The app should have a menu in the `AppBar` which will be different on each of the two panes. The `All` pane will have only a `Settings`
menu, while the `Categories` pane will have a 'Settings' and a `Categories` menu.

Clicking on the `Settings` menu will show a toast indicating that the respective menu was clicked.

Clicking on the `Categories` menu will show a popup menu with two options. Clicking on an option will change the message in the activity's
main window.
